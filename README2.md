Project 1 MovieFirst
This project is developed for a Web application to help users 
promote there creative work and possibly sold to leaders in the Movie industry. Artist will be able to expose there work and collaborate on projects with other users. Investors would be able to invest in potential projects from this site.

Usability: Users will be able to Login to the project, by viewing the login page and clicking on the Login button. There if the user needs to register for the first time there is a link on the login page reference register button. This takes the user to the registration page. After the information from the users has been entered on the form, the user will click on the register form and it will lead the user back to the login page.
Forgot password: The user also has the ability to click on the forgot password button from the login page, to reset password. this will take the user to the reset password page. once password has been changed and submitted, the user is sent back to the login page.
Admin dashboard Page: At this moment for demo purposes. The user is sent to the admin page from login. The admin page has information for the administrator about projects and about all users. if the administrator clicks on a user button it will take him/her to a users profile page. This information allows the administrator to view all history and current activities about the user. The administrator has the ability to logout of the system at the bottom of the page or click back to the administrator dashboard.
Technologies used: .html, .css, .js
Future improvements: The user needs to be able to login to the site and interact with the site. The site needs to have the ability to upload documents and save to a database. The site needs to be able to interact back with the user by adding in prompts.
More to come.... 

This is a new project for class!
Today I plan to work on the log in and signup buttons on the home page. Plans to allow the log in to respond to a click which will open the dashboard page. 
The code being added for the signup button should open to a registration page before allowing the end user to access the dashboard!
